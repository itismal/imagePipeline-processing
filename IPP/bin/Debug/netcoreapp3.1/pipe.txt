## Welcome to Image Pipeline Processing (IPP) PipeFile ##

# Lines beginning with '#' are comments

# Feel Free to make your own comments using '#'.
# Comments can be made in any line EXCEPT node input lines.
# Feel free to leave empty lines if you like (see second line).
#Space after # in comment lines does not affect pipe data processing. Just like this line itselft.

# NODE & COMMENT LINES SHOULD BE SEPARATE.
# '#' as first character in new line is an identifier of comments.
# EMPTY lines will be omitted in processing automatically.

## Node usage from pipe file ##
## 	ATTENTION	##
# There are three nodes in total: Noise, Vignette and Convolve.
# They are reusable nodes. Use them in any order and repeat it as much as you like!

#Noise has 'noisePercent' as its parameter which describes amount 
#of noise to be inserted. Parameter range: 0 <= parameter <=1 (decimals included)

#Convolve has 'kernel' as its parameter. 
#'kernel' can take ONLY one of these parameters: blur, edge or sharpen.

#Vignette has no parameters.

## FOR EXAMPLE (copy paste them without hash in new line and enjoy!) ##
# node=vignette

# node=convolve kernel=sharpen
# node=convolve kernel=edge
# node=convolve kernel=blur

# node=noise noisePercent=0.15/0.02/0.50/etc

## NOTE: NO SPACES BETWEEN '='

# Following is an example on how to edge in one of best way possible
# in scope of this program.

node=vignette
node=convolve kernel=sharpen
node=convolve kernel=edge
