## Node usage from pipe file ##
## 	ATTENTION	##
#There are three nodes in total: Noise, Vignette and Convolve.
#They are reusable nodes.

#Noise has 'noisePercent' as its parameter which describes amount 
#of noise to be inserted. Parameter range: 0 <= parameter <=1
#Convolve has 'kernel' as its parameter. 
#'kernel' can take any one of these parameters: blur, edge or sharpen.
#Vignette has no parameters.

## FOR EXAMPLE ##
#node=vignette
#node=convolve kernel=sharpen
#node=convolve kernel=edge
#node=convolve kernel=blur
#node=noise noisePercent=0.15
##Note: no spaces between '='.

node=convolve kernel=blur
node=noise noisePercent=0.3
